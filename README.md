# RL Project
Navigating through the Minihack Quest-Hard dungeon using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

# Environment
### Minihack [[repo link](https://github.com/facebookresearch/minihack)]

# Models
### Deep Q-Network

### Advantage Actor Critic

# Running
The models were run in [[google colab](https://colab.google.com)]. In order to run `DQN.ipynb` and `A2C.ipynb` files, you need:
1. Upload the `.py` files in the runtime in google colab after loading the notebooks. For `DQN.ipynb`, you need to upload the following files
  1.1. `model.py`
  1.2. `agent.py`
  1.3. `replay_buffer.py`
2. To run `A2C.ipynb`, you need to upload only `model.py` file.
3. After uploading the files you can run the notebooks.
