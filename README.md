# RL Project
Navigating through the Minihack Quest-Hard dungeon using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

# Environment
### Minihack [[repo link](https://github.com/facebookresearch/minihack)]
In this project, we are using Reinforcement Learing to navigate through the `MiniHack-Quest-Hard-v0`. Navigating through the quest hard dungeon requires many skils in order to get to the goal location. The following tasks needs to be completed in order to solve this problem:

- Exit the maze
- Cross the lava river
- Defeat the boss monster
- Exit the level at the stairs down

# Models
### Deep Q-Network

### Advantage Actor Critic

# Running
The models were run in [[google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)]. In order to run notebooks:
1. Upload the `.py` files in the runtime in google colab after loading the notebooks. For `DQN.ipynb`, you need to upload the following files
    - `model.py`
    - `agent.py`
    - `replay_buffer.py`
2. To run `A2C.ipynb`, you need to upload only `model.py` file.
3. After uploading the files you can run the notebooks.
